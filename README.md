===============================================

This archive contains one ready-to-upload static website template you can host on GitHub Pages (or Netlify/Vercel).

Folders:
- multi-page/    -> Classic multi-page site (index.html, features.html, bestiary.html, media.html, contact.html)

How to deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload the contents of one of the folders to the repository root (or the gh-pages branch).
3. Go to repository Settings -> Pages, and select the main branch (or gh-pages) as source.
4. Your site will be available at https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/ within a minute.

Notes:
- Replace the placeholder images in each folder's /assets with your real sprites, screenshots, and flame PNG.
- Edit index.html (and other pages) to update text, links, and embed your trailer (YouTube/itch).
- The CSS uses the Google font 'Press Start 2P' for a retro pixel feel. Feel free to swap with any pixel font.

Enjoy! Replace assets and tweak styles to match your final art.
